My goal with this mod pack is to provide more interesting building options. Many of these ideas are based on work by other creators, in the credits.

• Adjusted impressiveness, space, and beauty for more realistic room scores.
• Shelves cost less and build faster. Added single-tile and wall shelves.
• Added wall, ceiling, and outdoor lights.
• Improved color saturation of workbenches.
• Tool to deconstruct power conduits.
• Door mats to wipe your feet on.
• Wall embrasures you can shoot through.
• Melee and ranged training dummies.
• Opening and closing doors makes no sound.
• Removed rock clutter from smoothed floors.
• Replace Stuff by Uuugggg
• [KV] RimFridge • 1.0 by Kiame Vivacity
• Roof Support 1.0 by Match
• Secret Passage Doors by Blake
• Subsurface Conduit by Murmur
• Tables+ by Barksalot
• [KV] Trading Spot • 1.0 by Kiame Vivacity
